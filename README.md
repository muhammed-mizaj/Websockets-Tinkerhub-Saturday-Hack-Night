A classical Tug of war is a sport that pits two teams against each other in a test of strength: teams pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal being to bring the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team's pull.

This web app version is a multiplayer game, where players can continuosly tap on the respetive part of the screen to earn points for their team. The team with the maximum points wins the game. 

- The aim of each player is to expand their teams territory as much as possible.

## Working
Two teams can participate at a time, namely 1 and 2. A team can have multiple members (on multiple devices). The team members can tap on the button to increase score of the team.
First team which reaches the maximum difference of distance from other team (here,we took difference of 10 point) wins the game.
